        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, and moved to California as a child. I received all my schooling in Southern California, then studied in Istanbul and worked in Madrid as an adult. My own personal experiences of living, learning, and reconciling multiple cultures and languages led to my passion for providing culturally sensitive counseling - especially for those who feel like there isn’t anyone who truly gets their experiences and struggles.

          For immigrants in particular, the feeling of being displaced in your own home while no longer being truly accepted by your home culture can be very disorienting. Learning to find home in your own skin as a multicultural person takes intentional effort and hard work. That’s why I specialize in working with individuals to be at peace with their own chosen multicultural identities. 
        </p>

        I also value and respect the power of relationships. Being in a romantic relationship with someone means inviting another human being to share in our identities and in our inner worlds. And in doing so, we give that person the key to lifting us up or bringing us down. By their intimate and vulnerable nature, relationships are extremely powerful, and it is my passion to help couples love themselves and their partners in healing and breakthrough ways.

        As a therapist, I see myself as a collaborator to your own unique journey of restorative experiences. I practice judgment free acceptance to create a therapeutic space for all clients to have the freedom to be their own genuine selves. For me, it is always a privilege to be invited to know someone’s intimate self and to partner alongside them.
        </p>
        <p>
        My Christian faith heavily informs my therapeutic approach. I believe it is my duty to honor every person as the imago dei (the image of God), and I find great joy in doing my part to bring the Kingdom through the healing and restoration of individuals and relationships. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I look forward to connecting with you on your journey of living the life you were created for.
